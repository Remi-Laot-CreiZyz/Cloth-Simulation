# Cloth-Simulation

Cloth simulation project undertaken for my "Physics Based Animation" courses at Edinburgh Napier University (under the direction of Benjamin Kenwright).
This project is based on a research paper from [Bender J., Weberb D., Diziolc R.]: Fast and stable cloth simulation based on multi-resolution shape matching. (Computers & Graphics 37, 8 (2013),
